## Organization of this training

Datica created this training because they wanted something that could be distributed to all new hires to give them a crash course on HIPAA. While it is true there are plenty of HIPAA training options, both free and paid, they did not feel that any were created for employees of modern health technology vendors.

Seeing an opportunity to help the industry and ideally reduce the barriers to people coming into healthcare from outside the industry, both things they are passionate about at Datica, they decided to reuse some of their existing content, from their blog, and generate a bunch of new content. If you have feedback or suggestions, please [email](mailto:<%= company[:training_email] %>) the training coordinator who will share the feedback with Datica.

Datica has tried to organize this in the most logical way possible. Each section below has multiple subsections, and provides links to additional resources at the end. There is a quiz towards the end, which is meant to force you to actively engage, and break up the passive nature of the training.
